# OmniRoute: The World Brain Logistics Layer 🌐📦

**OmniRoute** is a decentralized logistics intelligence (DLI) subnet built on **Bittensor**. It transforms global supply chain management from a reactive, siloed process into a proactive, "World Brain" optimization engine. By leveraging the 2026 **dTAO** architecture and **Multi-Synapse Harmonic Scoring (MSHS)**, OmniRoute incentivizes miners to synthesize real-time data from across the metagraph to solve the world’s most complex routing challenges.

## 🚀 Vision
In a global economy plagued by fragmentation and "Black Swan" disruptions, OmniRoute provides a resilient, machine-speed settlement layer for logistics intelligence. We don't just find the shortest path; we find the **smartest** path by bridging the collective intelligence of the Bittensor network.
