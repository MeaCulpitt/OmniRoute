# OmniRoute Subnet: Go-To-Market Strategy (GTM)

## 1. Initial Target Users & Use Cases
OmniRoute focuses on high-value, high-volatility segments where predictive accuracy directly impacts the bottom line.
* **High-Tech Manufacturing:** Just-in-Time (JIT) supply chains for semiconductors and automotive parts.
* **Cold-Chain Logistics:** Real-time risk mitigation for pharmaceuticals and perishable food.
* **Digital Freight Forwarders:** API-first logistics providers seeking a "Predictive Edge" over legacy competitors.

## 2. Distribution & Growth Channels
- **Enterprise Connectors:** Specialized plugins for SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft Dynamics to allow "low-friction" subnet testing.
- **Validator Gateways:** Institutional staking partners providing simplified, compliant access to the subnet's intelligence for traditional corporations.
- **Open-Source Visualization:** Community-built dashboards that translate miner "Inference Packets" into actionable supply chain "Control Towers."

## 3. Incentives for Early Participation
To bootstrap the network effect, OmniRoute employs targeted economic multipliers during the "Genesis Phase":
- **Miner Alpha Multiplier:** 1.5x emission weighting for miners who introduce unique, high-fidelity data sources (e.g., private IoT feeds, localized labor news).
- **Oracle Rewards:** Validators providing verified "Ground Truth" data from proprietary physical sensors receive enhanced V-Trust standing.
- **Enterprise Staking Tiers:** Early stakers of the Alpha token ($\alpha$) receive "Guaranteed Latency" and "Priority Inference" during periods of high network congestion.

## 4. Scaling to 2027
The long-term goal is to transition the subnet from a "Token-Incentivized" model to a "Service-Revenue" model, where external API fees are used to buy back and burn Alpha tokens, ensuring sustainable yield for all participants.
