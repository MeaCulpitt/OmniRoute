## Initial Target Users

- Need better routes but can't afford enterprise pricing

### Phase 2: E-commerce Companies

- Ship internationally regularly
- Not big enough for dedicated logistics teams
- Want better rates, don't want to manage forwarders

### Phase 3: Any Shipper

- Eventually open to anyone
- API-first approach
